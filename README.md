# Java Encryption Example <br>
This Java program is an example of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

### Symmetric Encryption
Symmetric encryption uses a shared key to both encrypt and decrypt the data. In this program, we have implemented the AES algorithm for symmetric encryption. You can provide the input text and a key, and the program will encrypt the text using AES encryption.

### Asymmetric Encryption
Asymmetric encryption uses public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt the data. In this program, we have implemented the RSA algorithm for asymmetric encryption. You can generate the public and private keys using the program and then use them to encrypt and decrypt the input text.
